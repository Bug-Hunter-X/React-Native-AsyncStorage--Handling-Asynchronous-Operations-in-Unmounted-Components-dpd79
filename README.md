# React Native AsyncStorage: Handling Asynchronous Operations in Unmounted Components

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native applications involving AsyncStorage and asynchronous operations.  The bug occurs when a component attempts to access or modify AsyncStorage after it has been unmounted from the component tree.

## Problem Description
Asynchronous operations, like fetching data from AsyncStorage, can take some time to complete. If a component unmounts before these operations finish, you can encounter errors or unexpected behavior. This is because the component no longer exists, but the asynchronous operation is still trying to update its state.

## Solution
The key to resolving this issue is to properly handle the cleanup phase of the component's lifecycle. By using the cleanup function within the `useEffect` hook, you can cancel or ignore asynchronous operations that are no longer relevant after the component is unmounted.  The solution includes a `return()` statement in `useEffect` to execute the cleanup function before unmounting.
